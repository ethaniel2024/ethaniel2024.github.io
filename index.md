## Introduction

I’m a Statistics major at Brigham Young University with an emphasis in data science, focused on applying analytics inside real operational systems rather than isolated technical work. I’m especially interested in how data informs decisions in complex, real-world environments like supply chain and manufacturing.

My academic and professional interests sit at the intersection of analytics, operations, and judgment—where statistical thinking supports clarity, tradeoff evaluation, and execution.
